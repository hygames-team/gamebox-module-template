# GameBox template module

This repository exists to make it as easy as possible for anyone to create a module for [GameBox](https://gamebox.hygames.co). You can start any of your modules using this repository as a template.

Things to change:
* content of `module.json`
  * Except for a version (semantic) and ID all fields are optional
* move everything to your own package if you want to ;)

For more information on GameBox modules, please check [the documentation](https://www.hygames.co/gamebox/modules).
